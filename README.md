# Stock Trading Strategy Optimizer

This Python script implements a stock trading strategy optimizer using quarterly returns data. It downloads historical stock data, processes it, optimizes buy and sell thresholds, and applies a trading strategy based on these thresholds.

## Features

- Downloads historical stock data using yfinance
- Calculates quarterly returns
- Implements a trading strategy based on buy and sell thresholds
- Optimizes thresholds using the Sharpe ratio
- Visualizes strategy performance against benchmark
- Provides latest trading signal and suggested action

## Requirements

python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.optimize import minimize


## Usage

1. Set the stock ticker, start date, and end date:

python
ticker = "AAPL"
start_date = "2014-05-05"
end_date = "2024-12-20"
```

2. Run the script to:
   - Download and process data
   - Optimize buy and sell thresholds
   - Apply the trading strategy
   - Display results and plot performance

## Functions

### `download_data(ticker, start_date, end_date)`
Downloads historical stock data using yfinance.

### `process_data(data)`
Calculates quarterly returns and removes any NaN values.

### `trading_strategy(returns, buy_threshold, sell_threshold)`
Generates buy, sell, or hold signals based on returns and thresholds.

### `calculate_strategy_returns(data, buy_threshold, sell_threshold)`
Calculates returns based on the trading strategy signals.

### `objective(params, data)`
Objective function for optimization, maximizing the Sharpe ratio.

### `optimize_thresholds(data)`
Optimizes buy and sell thresholds using scipy's minimize function.

### `apply_strategy(data, buy_threshold, sell_threshold)`
Applies the trading strategy to the data and calculates cumulative returns.

### `display_results(data)`
Prints the latest trading signal and suggested action.

## Output

The script outputs:
- Optimized buy and sell thresholds
- A plot comparing the strategy's cumulative returns to the benchmark
- The latest trading signal and suggested action
